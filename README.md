A "Painting" programm for TI cas calculators (The ones with python).
Currently only supports lines and rectangles.
## Known issues
Keys won't recognized:
This seems to be a problem with the TI_system libary so i can't solve that (Or maybe me who knows).
Images with more then about 20 objects are not drawn in real time:
This is due to TI_draw not letting me make layers etc and so when i want to remove an object i have to clear the entire screen and redraw everything :(
